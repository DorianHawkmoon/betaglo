{"name":"Betaglo","tagline":"Arduino code for a hand to control a computer","body":"# Betaglo\r\nThis project consist of an human interface with the computer. A glove let us to control the mouse, writing with the keyboard and execute some predefined commands.\r\n[Pictures and a demo video with a little more information (not done yet)](link page)\r\n\r\n## making betaglo\r\nFirst of all, we needed a gloves, wires and some sensors (flexors and pressure sensors). An arduino with a bluetooth module and a computer with linux to control.\r\nIn our case, flexors of 7cm and pressure of 2cm of diameter. After the test, we think flexors of 11cm and pressure with less diameter will work better.\r\nAlso we used a raspberry as a computer to control and an Arduino Atmega 2560.\r\n\r\nSewing the sensors to the glove, we used some tape to help us.\r\n(image)\r\n[photo sewing](Images/sewing.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe circuit is based on the next diagram, one wire to 5V and another wire with two branchs, one with a resistance to mass and another to an input of arduino. All the wires to the same destiny, was soldered in the same wire (mass and 5V). We used some tape to gather up al lthe wires to have a better look.\r\n[wires](Images/wires.jpg)\r\n[soldering](Images/soldering.jpg)\r\n[testing](Images/testing.jpg)\r\n\r\nOur glove suck because we have to unsolder and solder it again because of a mistake (the way it looked the first time... so beautiful)\r\n[final test](Images/final testing.jpg)\r\n\r\n## coding betaglo\r\nSimples lines of code. Pairing the bluetooth device and the computer is needed.\r\nThe computer needs to install the library python-serial and xdotool.\r\nIn the code, we set three states of the hand, mouse mode, keyboard mode and command mode\r\n\r\nindex finger = A\r\nmiddle finger = B\r\nring finger = C\r\npinky = D\r\n\r\n### mouse mode\r\nflexors:\r\n- A -> move down\r\n- B -> move up\r\n- C -> move left\r\n- D -> move right\r\n\r\npressure:\r\n- A normal -> click\r\n- A strong -> hold click\r\n- B normal -> right click\r\n- B strong -> release click\r\n- C normal -> Ctrl+C\r\n- C strong -> change to command's state\r\n- D normal -> Ctrl+V\r\n- D strong -> change to keyboard's state\r\n\r\n\r\n### command mode\r\nflexor not operative\r\n\r\n- A normal -> Ctrl+z\r\n- B normal -> browser (epiphany, installed in raspbian)\r\n- C strong -> come back to mouse's state\r\n\r\n### keyboard mode\r\nflexor not operative\r\n\r\nStrong click change the keyboard's state\r\n- A -> symbols' keyboard\r\n- B -> change between lowercase and uppercase in normal keyboard state. From another state, change to letters' keyboard\r\n- C -> numbers' keyboard\r\n- D -> Regresa al estado del ratón\r\n\r\n| A normal  | B normal  | C normal | D normal |\r\n|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|\r\n|     S     |     O     |    A     |    E     |\r\n|     D     |     I     |    N     |    R     |\r\n|     U     |     T     |    C     |    L     |\r\n|     G     |     B     |    P     |    M     |\r\n|     H     |     Q     |    Y     |    V     |\r\n|     Ñ     |     J     |    Z     |    F     |\r\n|           |     K     |    W     |    X     |\r\n\r\n| A normal  | B normal  | C normal | D normal |\r\n|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|\r\n|     1     |     2     |    3     |    4     |\r\n|     5     |     6     |    7     |    8     |\r\n|     9     |     0     |          |          |\r\n\r\n\r\n| A normal  | B normal  | C normal | D normal |\r\n|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|\r\n|   Space   |     .     |    ,     |  Enter   |\r\n|     !     |     ?     |    (     |  Delete  |\r\n|     )     |     ¡     |    ¿     |   \"      |\r\n|     :     |     ;     |    '     |          |","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
